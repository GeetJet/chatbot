step 4:

In step four, 
check Trolley is in good working condition,
arm is locked in vertical position, no

Check Venturi Material, Size, PN and revision
With this comes the end of step 4.

step 5:

Move the trolley to the crane area

step 8

Assemble ringbolt on any two mounting points such that the ringbolts are almost 180 degree apart (Opposite each other).

step 9
